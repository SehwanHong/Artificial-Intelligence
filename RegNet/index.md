# [Designing Network Design Spaces](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13678.pdf)

The goal of this paper is to help advance the understanding of network design aand discover design principles that generalize across the setting. Instead of focusing on designing individual network instances, author design network design space that parameterize population of network.
