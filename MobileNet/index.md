# [MobileNets:Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks for Mobile Vision Application](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04861.pdf)

MobileNets are based on streamlined architecutre that uses depthwise separable convolutions to build light wieght deep neural networks. In this paper, author introudce two global hyper parameters that efficiently trade off between latency and accuracy
