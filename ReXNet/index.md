# [Rethinking Channel Dimensions for Efficient Model Design](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.00992.pdf)

Designing an efficient model within limited computational cost is challenging. In this paper, author focus on four large topic:

1. study an effective channel dimension configuration towards better performance.
2. study how to design a single layer properly by analyzing the rank of the output features.
3. investigate channel configuration of a model by searching network architectures concerning the channel configuration under computational cost restriction.
4. propose a simple but effective channel configuration that can be parameterized by the layer index.
